Dear SAAST staff,
	I am writing to apply for the position of RTA for the 2015 session of SAAST. I am interested in RTAing courses in both Computer Science and Computer Graphics. As a freshman in Digital Media Design, I would love to share my passion and enthusiasm for programming to other students who are interested exploring and learning more. The cross between programming and art is a force that is changing the world. I believe that the growing field of computer graphics is an artistic and cultural force thatâ€™s shaping the future of entertainment, tech, business, and more. 
Personally, the only experience that I had with computer science before coming to Penn Engineering was a very shallow high school course that breezed upon the AP Computer Science curriculum. Of course, ultimately, it helped me to get a feel for the world of computers, but I really wish that I had the chance to delve deeper into computer science before coming to college. From hackathons to code challenges, there is always an opportunity to use my coding abilities, and a program like SAAST would have given me the skills to engage in these events earlier and in more depth. Thus, I would like to become an RTA to give talented high school students the chance to explore and learn about skills that are essential to making a difference in our society.
	From an academic perspective, my course load at Penn will have me adequately prepared to be an RTA for computer graphics or computer science. After the Spring 2015 semester, I will have completed CIS 120, CIS 121, and FNAR 264. As an educator and mentor, I would feel comfortable with teaching high school students the material that I have learned in each class. After spending several weeks in Ghana teaching local school-children, I realize the importance of clear and concise communication with students, both in a classroom setting as well as in a one-on-one mentoring environment.
